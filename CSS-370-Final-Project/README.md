# Project Description
Computer Builder is a collaborative project between Adrian Unruh, Ulysess Steenmeyer, Mohammed Ali, Kiernan Connolly, Suhyun Bae, and myself. The project was the culmination of the work done through the quarter in the Analysis and Design course.

Computer Builder is a web application that can be used to build a custom computer. The user will input various specifications, such as what activities the computer will be used for (gaming, graphic design, programming, etc.), a piece of hardware (for example, a specific graphics card or processor), a price budget, already owned parts, or any combination of specifications. The web application will then display the parts required to build a custom computer for the inputted specifications, ensuring that compatibility issues are accounted for. If it is not possible to build the computer using the given specifications, the application will then recommend a computer that best fits the given specifications.
